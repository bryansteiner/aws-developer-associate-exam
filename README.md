# Exam Study Path

The following is my study path for the **AWS Certified Developer Associate Exam (DVA-C01)**:

- Learning Phase:
    - [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/) - Unlike the study path for the AWS Certified Solutions Archtitect Associate Exam, I chose the Linux Academy course over A Cloud Guru (better content). I completed the AWS Certified Developer Associate course and associated labs. Again, they were very useful primer for what to expect on the exam but taking the course alone isn't enough to pass the exam.
    - [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/) + [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/index.html) - This time, in addition to the developer guides, I made sure to read through relevant API references from the AWS official site. For example when learning CloudFront, I would experiment closely using the the [AWS CLI](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/cloudfront/index.html) and make sure to understand a command's associated API requests made from the [API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).
    - [AWS Introduction to DevOps](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_DevOps.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card) - I read through this whitepaper which covered the following concepts: Infrastructure as Code (IAC), Continuous Deployment (CD), Automation, Monitoring, and Security
- Exam Preparation:
    - [AWS Cheat Sheets](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheets/) - Within a couple of weeks of finishing the course, I studied the set of interactive Diagrams from Linux Academy ([Sigma Scripts](https://interactive.linuxacademy.com/diagrams/TheSigmaScripts.html)) and then went through cheatsheets from Tutorials Dojo.
        - I found these cheatsheets to be a very concise version of the documentation I referred to earlier and this helped to speed up my prep time.
    - [Exam Readiness](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=19185) - In the week before the exam, I took this official AWS course to test my preparedness. It greatly helped to understand the logistics of the exam and understanding the structure + question types.
    - Exam Guide:
        - Current version - [DVA-C01](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-dev-associate/AWS-Certified-Developer-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf)
    - Sample Questions:
        - Current version - [DVA-C01](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-dev-associate/AWS-Certified-Developer-Associate_Sample-Questions.pdf)
    - Practice Exams:
        - [Official AWS Practice Exam](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/) - Highly recommended.
        - [Jon Bonso's Practice Exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams/) - I went ahead and purchased these practice exams because I found them to have great coverage and they were helpful for passing the Solutions Architect associate exam.
        - [Linux Academy Practice Exam](https://app.linuxacademy.com/) - This was included with my subscription to Linux Academy.
        - [Whiz Labs Practice Exam](https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-developer-associate/) - I only attempted the Free Test with 25 questions.
